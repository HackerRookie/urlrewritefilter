= Proposed Features =

== Features for 3.1 ==

  * Full mod_rewrite configuration support (including RewriteMap)


== Later Releases ==

  * Allowing UrlRewrite to be initialized and configured in a Spring application context

  * Allowing UrlRewrite to be controlled at runtime using JMX (which could be done with almost no effort in a Spring-based env if UrlRewrite were more amenable)

  * apache httpd configuration parser for tomcat.  This would allow administrators to try tomcat without having to learn how to configure it.  mod_rewrite style configuration is a critical component for this.
